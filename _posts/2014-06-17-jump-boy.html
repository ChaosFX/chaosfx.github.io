This is my new game I made with the awesome 'Phaser Framework'. It's not feater complete yet but I would love to get your feedback on it.
</p>

<h3>controlles / gameplay</h3>
<p>
    Move and jump with the arrow keys. You can double jump when you get the timing right. The goal of each level is to collect all the coins so you can move on trough the door to the next level.

I made Jump Boy to look like an classic 'Gameboy' game. I only used four shades of green to create the graphics. The orignal size of the game is only 180px * 144px, but I doubled the size afterwards to create a more pixel art look and feel.
